          Kerala is always referred to as God's own country. This term has a
          mythological belief that states that- Lord Parshuram, a manifestation
          of Lord Vishnu threw his axe into the vast sea to develop land for his
          followers to reside peacefully. And that is how the state of Kerala
          was born from the god itself.
